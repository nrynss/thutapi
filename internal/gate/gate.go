// Package gate stands in front of the routes that spend money.
//
// A full generation is roughly $0.35 and six minutes of model time
// (PLAN.md §T11 item 1), and the app is deployed at a public URL. An
// ungated generate button is an open wallet, so PLAN.md records the gate
// as "the thing that must exist before the URL is public".
//
// # Decision 9 — passcode or per-IP cap
//
// PLAN.md §Decisions row 9 left "passcode or per-IP cap" open. Settled
// here as **both, with the cap always on and the passcode optional**:
//
//   - Every protected route carries a two-level token bucket: one bucket
//     per client key, and one process-wide bucket the whole route shares.
//     This is on by default, needs no configuration, and keeps the demo a
//     single tap for a judge — which a passcode-by-default would not.
//   - A shared passcode is enforced on the same routes when, and only
//     when, Config.Passcode is set. It is the lever an operator flips
//     (one environment variable and a restart) if the URL is found and
//     abused during judging. Leaving it off by default is the deliberate
//     half of the decision: a hackathon URL nobody can use scores the same
//     as one that was never deployed.
//
// The passcode is deliberately not an HTTP authentication scheme. It is
// read from the X-Thutapi-Passcode header or the thutapi_gate cookie and
// answered with 403, never 401 with WWW-Authenticate, because a browser
// basic-auth prompt in the middle of a child's story is worse than the
// 403 the shell already knows how to render.
//
// # Which routes, and which routes never
//
// Protect wraps individual handlers, never the mux, so nothing is gated
// by accident. Static assets, GET /healthz, GET /media/{id} and the book
// page stay ungated on purpose: /healthz is what the box's monitoring
// hits, and a book URL is meant to be opened and shared by a judge with
// no passcode and no budget of their own (PLAN.md §T11 item 1).
//
// # The client key, behind Cloudflare and Traefik
//
// The deployment is Cloudflare → Traefik → this process on a docker
// bridge network, so r.RemoteAddr is always the proxy and never a
// client. Forwarded headers are therefore the only source of a client
// address, and they are attacker-controlled input:
//
//   - Headers are read **only** when the direct peer is inside
//     Config.TrustedProxies (loopback and the RFC1918 / ULA ranges by
//     default, which is exactly what Traefik on the docker bridge is).
//     From an untrusted peer the peer address itself is the key and every
//     forwarding header is ignored.
//   - From a trusted peer, CF-Connecting-IP wins, because Cloudflare sets
//     it and overwrites whatever the client sent. X-Forwarded-For is the
//     fallback, and the **rightmost** entry is used, not the leftmost:
//     the leftmost is whatever the client chose to send, since each proxy
//     appends rather than replaces.
//   - IPv4 keys are the address; IPv6 keys are the /64, so one delegated
//     prefix is one client rather than 2^64 of them.
//
// **The per-client key is fairness, not security, and the doc says so
// plainly.** Anyone who reaches the origin IP directly, bypassing
// Cloudflare, can put any CF-Connecting-IP they like on each request and
// mint a fresh bucket every time. That is why every Rule also carries a
// process-wide Global bucket that no client key can widen: the spoofable
// header can cost an honest client their share, but it cannot raise the
// total spend of the route above Global. Bucket memory is bounded too
// (Config.MaxClients, with full — i.e. debt-free — buckets evicted
// first), so header spoofing is not a memory sink either.
//
// Configuration arrives through Config; this package never reads the
// environment (PLAN.md invariant 2), and its errors are sentinels matched
// with errors.Is (invariant 8).
